The final output must be in SRT (SubRip Text) format, including timestamps. Make sure the output is only the SRT content.`,

When referencing specific moments, include timestamps in the format [HH:MM:SS] or [MM:SS] (e.g., "At [02:15] the speaker discusses..."). The response must be in ${targetLang} and in Markdown format.`,
  analysisKeyInfoPrompt: (targetLang: string) => `Analyze this video and identify 5-10 key moments or significant topic shifts. For each item, provide a timestamp at the start of the line in the exact format [HH:MM:SS], followed by a brief description. If there are no clear "events," focus on when the speaker moves to a new topic or makes a critical point. Format the entire output as a list. Each item must be a single line. Do not add any preamble or explanation before the list. Example: "[00:02:15] The speaker introduces the concept of neural networks." The response must be in ${targetLang}.`,
  analysisTopicsPrompt: (targetLang: string) => `Identify the 3 to 5 most important topics and themes discussed or shown in this video. List them as just the topic titles in a Markdown bullet point list. Do not add explanations. The response must be in ${targetLang}.`,

IMPORTANT: When referencing specific moments in the video, ALWAYS include timestamps in the format [HH:MM:SS] or [MM:SS]. For example: "At [02:15] the speaker discusses..." or "The key point is mentioned at [01:23:45]...". This helps users navigate to the exact moment you're referring to.`,
